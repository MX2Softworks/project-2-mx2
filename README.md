# project-2-mx2
The second project under MX2 Softworks. A platformer game.

Due to the shortcomings of the first project, the second project will be much simpler.
The first step will be to create a barebones prototype of a generic platformer.
From there the team will evaluate their work and evolve the prototype into a unique game.

The coding will be done in Game Maker Studio.

The project will be housed in the MX2 Softworks Github Organization.
